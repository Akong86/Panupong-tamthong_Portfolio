Overview
Designed and developed a high-impact Manufacturing Dashboard to monitor and analyze a fleet of 10,000 machines, focusing on improving operational reliability and reducing downtime.

Key Achievements

Failure Monitoring: Tracks a 3.39% overall failure rate across the entire fleet.

Root Cause Identification: Utilized Correlation Analysis to pinpoint mechanical and thermal patterns. Identified "Heat Dissipation" as the primary root cause behind most breakdowns.

Predictive Insights: Established critical baselines to detect potential issues before they occur:


Torque-Speed: Analyzed the Inverse Relationship to set the baseline for operating loads.


Process-Air Temp: Leveraged Linear Correlation to detect overheating outliers.

Continuous Improvement (CI): Proposed data-driven strategies to transition maintenance from a reactive to a proactive approach.
